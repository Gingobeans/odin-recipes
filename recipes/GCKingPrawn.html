    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This <strong>amazing</strong> garlic and chilli King Prawn recipe
    comes from Jamie Oliver, it has a Spanish origin with a splattering of smoked paprika and is 
    perfect with a chunk of good bread and a big glass of chilled white wine.</p>

    <p>The recipe is <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>easy</strong> to follow and can be cooked in under ten minutes - recommended for a quick lunch, starter or part of a tapas set.
    If you fancy you could even toss in some noodles or serve with rice to create a full dinner time meal.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 large raw shell-on king prawns</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
        <li>a few sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>50 ml olive oil , ideally Spanish</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>If not already done, ensure that you deshell the prawns and discard the vein (poo) by running knife down the back of the prawn</li>
        <li>Peel the garlic and finely chop along with the chilli, I personally keep the seeds in but if you don't want it spicy remove the seeds at this stage. At this stage you should also chop the parsley into small pieces.</li>
        <li>On a medium heat drizzle in your oil and add in the chilli, garlic and paprika to flavour the oil - ensure to stir and do this for around a minute</li>
        <li>Add the prawns and cook for 2 minutes each side (or until cooked) - when flipping the prawns add in 3/4s of your parsley</li>
        <li>Once prawns finished cooking squeeze in the lemon juice and remove from heat, sprinkle on remaining parsley and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Serve with a hunk of crusty bread and a chilled glass of white wine - YUM!</li>
    </ol>
